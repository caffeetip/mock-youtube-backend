    "description": "In most of the world, inhaling radon for pain relief sounds like a bizarre idea. In some places, though, it's so accepted that it's prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance. And I have no idea how to talk about it. Thanks to the team at the Radonstollen in Bad Kreuznach: you can find out more about them at https://www.acuradon.comSOURCES:The paper I reference in the video is Radon Exposure—Therapeutic Effect and Cancer Risk by Maier et al, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22010316 — it is, as far as I can tell, the most comprehensive analysis of all the studies so far, and I recommend reading not just the paper but also the extensive bibliography. As mentioned in the video, they claim no conflict of interest but some of the funding does ultimately come from the radon therapy industry.There are a LOT of papers about this, and about radiation hormesis. A Google Scholar search will rapidly send you down a rabbit hole of this seems like it works papers, followed by this study had a very small sample size or this study had flaws meta-analysis. I am not qualified to analyse their quality and conflicts of interest, so in this case, departing from my usual policy, I'm leaving that exploration as an exercise for the reader!Location camera: Moritz JanischProducer: Marcel Fenchel https://www.fenchel-janisch.com/Editor for Bad Kreuznach footage: Isla McTearI'm at https://tomscott.com\ron Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\ron Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\rand on Instagram as tomscottgo",

    "description": "Check out Fuel For Fans here! ➤ https://bit.ly/3bYEKGnUse code DRIVER61 for 20% off non-sale items!Lewis Hamilton has now strolled to victory in the last two races in Brazil and Qatar, but why is Lewis and the Mercedes apparently so much faster than Verstappen and the rest of the field? Why did Mercedes shine brightest under the lights at Losail?Red Bull had believed that Mercedes were somehow getting around the wing flex regulations. These are the rules that are supposed to stop the wings of the cars flexing at high speed, as the fast-moving air hits them. The more the wings flex, the less frontal area they have in the air, the flatter they are and so the less drag they create - meaning higher speeds along the straights, but the same downforce in the corners - an engineer’s dream.The FIA check the wing flex by adding weights to the wings, and measuring how much they move. However, as always in F1, there are ways around the test - to have the wing perform differently on the track than in scrutineering. ➤ Subscribe for more incredible motorsport: https://goo.gl/AbD2f9➤Follow us on:   ➤ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta   ➤TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok➤ iPad Drawing sponsored by Concepts, you can get an exclusive free trial here! - https://concepts.app/driver61📺 F1 Driver’s Technique Explained➤ Senna’s bizarre technique: https://bit.ly/3lORK59➤ How Schumacher’s style won 7 championships: https://bit.ly/3527cVz➤ Alonso’s strange steering: https://bit.ly/2Z7a93v➤ How Verstappen will be F1 champion: https://bit.ly/3jK6L6n➤ How Verstappen is so fast in the wet: https://bit.ly/32WMVhr📺 F1 Engineering➤ How F1 brakes work: https://bit.ly/3h0Whh0➤ How an F1 clutch works: https://bit.ly/3i0oDJM➤ What’s inside an F1 gearbox: https://bit.ly/2DzMqRW➤ How F1 teams change four tyres in two seconds: https://bit.ly/2QVpkIl🏎️ Track & Racing Driver!➤ Get a free report on your track driving: http://bit.ly/2LmYNBA➤ Get faster on track with our FREE 25-part tutorial series:http://bit.ly/2PypIMK➤ Our real-world training programmes: http://bit.ly/2ktjtgV🏁 Sim Racers!➤ My sim wheel: https://bit.ly/354BBlY➤ My sim pedals: https://bit.ly/3eJckQo➤ Our sim racing course: https://bit.ly/34WuV7p➤ Get a free report on your track driving: http://bit.ly/2LmYNBA➤ Driver61 Sim Racing Channel: http://bit.ly/2BMdk4B#F1 #QatarGP #TheF1Breakdown",

Today we're going to find out how easily you can catch every Pokemon in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. This video took a lot of time and effort to put together, so I'd really appreciate it if you shared this with a friend. If you have any suggestions for the next video, leave it in the comments below!

    "description": "A few days ago, I got a message from a mysterious Twitter user telling me to go visit a location on the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server where you can steal other players' hearts... Can I solve this Minecraft Puzzle in 24 Hours?Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. LifeSteal Members in this Video: @Vort3xDragon @rekrap2 @PrinceZam @Sponker @Pangi @roshambogames @Spoke @Vitalasy Discord: https://discord.gg/6dug29UrRHA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!",
